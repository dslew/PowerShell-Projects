# PowerShell-Projects

Welcome to PowerShell-Projects by David Lewis. This repository is designed to showcase my current PowerShell abilities to prospective employers.

# A little bit about me and PowerShell:
My first contact with PowerShell was during my CyberSecurity bootcamp at PwC. Unfortunately, it was quite an unpleasant experience for me, but that is a story for another repository. Regardless of this experience, I still developed an interest and determination to conquer PowerShell. Currently, I am working through 'PowerShell from Beginner To Sheller And Scripter' by David Fitzpatrick on Udemy.

# What's next? 
I have purchased two more PowerShell courses on Udemy to reinforce the basics I am currently learning. The focus in the not-so-distant future will be Automation and Tool Building.

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show as I track my progress in learning PowerShell.

Cheers!

Dave
